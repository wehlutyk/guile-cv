** November 2021

[[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-cv/][GNU Guile-CV]] version 0.3.1 is released.

This is a maintenance release, which fixes a bug in the =pre-inst-env=
script, which is used by Guile-CV at build time and may also be used
to test and run an uninstalled Guile-CV instance,

*** Changes since 0.3.0

Here is a summary of visible changes since version 0.3.0. See GNU
Guile-CV's [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git][git summary]] and [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/log/][git log]] for a complete description.

**** Bug fixing

The =pre-inst-env.in= script has been fixed and now adds a specific
build time library location, so Guile 3.0 (>= 3.0.6) finds libguile-cv
at build time.

Guile 3.0 (>= 3.0.6) does not use libltdl anymore, and although in guile
(system foreign-library) module, both the comment and the definition of
augment-ltdl-library-path seems to take care of finding .so files either
aside .la or in a .libs/ subdir, it does not work.

** November 2021

[[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-cv/][GNU Guile-CV]] version 0.3.0 is released.

This is a maintenance release, which allows Guile-CV to work with Guile
3.0 (>= 3.0.7 to be specific). In addition, im-transpose performance has
been improved.

The documentation has been restructured and follows the model we adopted
for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/g-golf][GNU G-Golf]]. The /Configuring Guile's raised exception system/
section has been updated. Make sure you carefully read and apply the
proposed changes.

*** Changes since 0.2.1

Here is a summary of visible changes since version 0.2.1. See GNU
Guile-CV's [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git][git summary]] and [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/log/][git log]] for a complete description.

**** Dependencies

Guile-CV allows Guile 3.0 (>= 3.0.7 to be specific). The minimal 2.0
version is now 2.0.14

	[[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile][Guile]]	 	>= 2.0.14
	  [allows 2.2, 3.0 (>= 3.0.7)]

The makeinfo program dependency is now version 6.6.

	Makeinfo	>= 6.6

**** Performance improvements

im-transpose
im-transpose-channel

  The f32vector-transpose core functionality has been moved to
  libguile-cv. Note that all memory allocation - except for some local
  variables - still is being performed in scheme.

  This makes im-tranpose work 22x faster. Because all memory allocation
  still is done in scheme, and not in C, I am very confortable with this
  approach. When Guile has an AOT compiler that compiles fixed size
  floating points and small integers operations and vector loops for
  these that runs as fast as in C, and I am prety confident that it will
  happen, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen, we will revert these
  and use Guile Scheme again.

**** Documentation

The documentation has been restructured and follows the model we adopted
for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/g-golf][GNU G-Golf]]. The /Configuring Guile's raised exception system/
section has been updated. Make sure you carefully read and apply the
proposed changes.
** November 2018

addition (a) ...

*** Changes since 0.2.0

Here is a summary of visible changes since version 0.2.0. See GNU
Guile-CV's [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git][git summary]] and [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/log/][git log]] for a complete description.

**** Dependencies

Vigra C >= commit 0af647d08 - Oct 28, 2018

  The local minima and maxima interfaces have been improved, and now
  support the full set of options provided by Vigra, to our request
  (thank you Benjamin!).  In addition there has been a few bugs fixed,
  including one we detected while working on Guile-CV local minima
  bindigs.

**** New interfaces

im-crack-edge
im-crack-edge-channel
im-local-minima
im-local-minima-channel
im-local-maxima
im-local-maxima-channel

**** Performance improvements

im-delineate
im-delineate-channel

  The f32vector-delineate core functionality has been moved to
  libguile-cv. Note that all memory allocation - except for some local
  variables - still is being performed in scheme.

  This move makes im-delineate work almost twice as fast. Because all
  memory allocation still is done in scheme, and not in C, I am very
  confortable with this approach. When Guile has an AOT compiler that
  compiles fixed size floating points and small integers operations and
  vector loops for these that runs as fast as in C, and I am prety
  confident that it will happen, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen,
  we will revert these and use Guile Scheme again.

** September 2018

Guile-CV version 0.2.0 is released.

This is a 'milestone' release, which introduces image texture measures.
In addition (a) the default installation locations have changed; (b)
there is a new configure option; (c) some new insterfaces; (d) matrix
multiplication performances have been greatly improved; (d) a few
interface (name) have changed.

*** Changes since 0.1.9

Here is a summary of visible changes since version 0.1.9. See GNU
Guile-CV's [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git][git summary]] and [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/log/][git log]] for a complete description.

**** Installation location changes

The default and --prefix installation locations for the source modules
and the compiled files have changed, and, in the absence of the new
configure option described below, are now:

  $(datadir)/guile-cv
  $(libdir)/guile-cv/guile/$(GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION)/site-ccache

In the above, $(datadir) is substituted to the default /usr/local/share
or /your/prefix/share and $(libdir) is substituted to /usr/local/lib or
/your/prefix/lib, when/if --prefix was passed.

$(GUILE_EFFECTIVE_VERSION) is substituted to the stable version number
with which Guile-CV is being compile, for example, 2.2

This change makes GNU Guile-CV compatible with the GNU Coding Standards,
but it also implies that, unless you use the new configure option
describe below, you will have to augment both Guile's variables
%load-path and %load-compiled-path, respectively, with the two
(substituted) paths described above, so that Guile finds Guile-CV's
installed source modules and compiled files (see Guile-CV's installation
'Notes' for more on this).

**** New configure option

The configure option --with-guile-site has been added, used to
explicitly ask Foliot's source modules to be installed in the
Guile-Gnome site directory, and the compiled files using Guile's
site-ccache directories respectively (see Foliot's installation 'Notes'
for more on this).

It will only be honored if (and only if) it is passed as:

  --with-guile-site=yes

  [ in this case, there is obviously no need to augment Guile's
  [ variables %load-path and %load-compiled-path

**** Interface changes

| New name           | Previous name                |
|------------------- +------------------------------|
| im-mtimes          | im-multiply         (matrix) |
| im-mtimes-channel  | im-multiply-channel          |
| im-times           | im-multiply         (scalar) |
| im-times-channel   | im-multiply-channel          |

The former two methods, related to matrix multiplication, are now
procedures.  The later two are methods: see the manual to see the
different ways you may call them.

| im-mdivide         | im-divide           (matrix) |
| im-mdivide-channel | im-divide-channel            |

Likewise, these were methods, they are now procedures.

**** New interfaces

im-times		(element by element)
im-times-channel
im-divide		(element by element)
im-divide-channel
im-texture
im-glcp
im-glcm

**** Performance improvements

im-mtimes
im-mtimes-channel
im-mdivide
im-mdivide-channel
im-invert
im-invert-channel

  These matrix operations (actually, their corresponding f32vector-*
  core functionality) have been moved to libguile-cv. Note that all
  memory allocation - except for some per-function local variables -
  still is being performed in scheme.

  This move makes a small black and white 515 x 515 image matrix
  multiplication by itself (for the sake of timing things) execute in
  0.228 sec instead of 29.51 sec - that is 134x faster.

  In image processing 'real world', this would be a tiny image, being
  134x faster for these linear algebra procedures makes a huge
  difference. Until Guile offers 32 bits floating point and integer
  calculus performances equal to or faster of those we get using
  libguile-cv, and since memory allocation is done in scheme, I am
  confortable with this approach.

** April 2018

Guile-CV version 0.1.9 is released.

*** Changes since 0.1.8

Here is a summary of visible changes since version 0.1.8. See GNU
Guile-CV's [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git][git summary]] and [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/log/][git log]] for a complete description.

**** Dependencies

Vigra C >= commit a2ff675f4 April 15, 2018

  new interface vigra_nonlocalmean_c (introduced in Jan 2018), has an
  argument that has been renamed;

  the vigra_medianfilter_c function (updated in Jan 2018 as well) takes
  an additional 'out-of-bound strategy' argument.

**** New interfaces

im-median-filter
im-median-filter-channel
im-nl-means
im-nl-means-channel

**** Bug fixes

latex-pdftoppm

  in the module (cv support latex) - undocumented but quite usefull
  procedure, to 'prepare' text to be added to images (see im-compose) -
  the optional keyword [#:res 72] argument was actually not used in the
  core of the procedure, fixed.

** December the 18th, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.8 is released!

Here is a summary of the changes since version 0.1.7. See GNU Guile-CV's
git summary [1] and git log [2] for a complete description:

	[1] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git
	[2] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/log/

*** Changes since 0.1.7

**** Dependencies

Vigra C >= commit 691b189b0 Oct 25, 2017

  A clipping bug has been fixed in vigra_exportgrayimage_c,
  vigra_exportrgbimage_c and vigra_exportrgbaimage_c. A new
  vigra_clipimage_c function is available and Guile-CV uses it.

**** Configuring Guile for Guile-CV

I finally got my hands on how to configure Guile's raised exception
system (special thanks to Daniel Lloren) so it does not 'blow' the repl
upon errors anymore, while using Guile-CV (or manipulating any other big
structures for that matters, huge lists, arrays, sfri-4 bytevectors
...).

As a consequence, the manual has been updated and now covers both
Guile's repl-print and raised exception system configuration, either
globally, or individually: it is highly recommended for all users, even
those who are already using GUile-CV I mean, not just new users, to very
carefully read and apply these two recommendations.

**** Interface changes

im-fill-holes
im-fill-holes-channel

  Previously, these two procedures were respectively named im-fill and
  im-fill-channel, but that was a bit ambiguous.

im-scrap

  New optional keyword, #:exclude-on-edges, for which the default is #f.

im-label
im-label-channel
im-label-all
im-label-all-channel

  Return n-label, not n-object. The number of labels correspond to the
  highest label value + 1: earlier version of Guile-CV, prior to version
  0.1.8, did return the number of objects, which correspond to the
  highest label value. This was less then optimal, since not only 0.0 is
  a label, but other procedures, im-features for example, do consider
  and return a feature object for the background as well.

  Note that Vigra C functions return the label highest value, but the
  vigra-label-all function starts to label using 1.0, so in this case,
  the label highest value is also the number of label used, hence
  im-label-all-channel has to return 'n-object' and not '(+ n-object
  1)', fixed.  I don't like this, for me it is inconsistent, and
  im-label-all should start to label using 0.0 as well, so I mailed the
  Vigra folks, let's see...

im-features

  Consistency between im-label, im-label-all and im-features. All these
  already named their argument 'n-label', but it actually ment 'n-object'.
  I changed all this - and the segmentation related code as well - so it
  is consistent everywhere in the code. And now, the n-label argument
  value also correspond to the length of the list of features returned,
  so much better.

  Vigra C functions, at the contrary, expect 'n-object', or expressed
  differently, expect the label highest value, which correspond to (-
  n-label 1).  This is also consistent everywhere in the code now.

im-binary?

  Now accepts more then one image.

**** New interfaces

im-clip
im-clip-channel
im-reconstruct
im-and-channel
im-or-channel
im-xor-channel
im-=-channel?
im-binary-channel?

or-l

  Though undocumented still, I list it her too: we had and-l already,
  and there are (well known among schemers) situations where you need a
  function (not a macro)...

im-composite->rgb

  Composite images only differs to others in the sence that they can
  have more then 3 channels, any number of channels actually, the 4th
  _not_ being the traditional alpha channel.  Each channel holds on
  specific information, depending on the application domaim.  It is
  sometime necessary to visualize these though, in which case they must
  be 'converted' to RGB images, hence this new procedure.  This is a
  'work in progress': as it is, it will only work if the composite image
  has 4 channels.  In this first implementation, the algorithm will
  super impose the 4th channel to the RGB's, so one says 'white pixels
  always win' (this because the 4th channel is (generally) associated
  with the White 'color').

**** Removed interfaces

im-list=?

  It was a bad idea to make this internal procedure public, and users
  can call (apply im-=? ...) anyway.

**** Performance improvements

im-rgb->gray
im-threshold

  Calls im-rgb->gray-1, which was unnecessary calling float-round at
  each step, and I also noticed that recursive tail call procedures have
  a tiny penalty compared to loop, so rewrote both.  Now, in addition,
  both procedures will split their work in between as many core as
  available, except if the parameter %use-par-map has been set to #f.
  On my laptop - i5-2450M CPU @ 2.50GHz × 4 and 5.7GB of mem - both
  procedures are now 3 to 4 times faster.

im-fill-holes

  Labels are 'discrete' floats, by definition, so we can use = instead
  of float=?, which is 3 to 4 times faster.

im-features

  Area, left, top, right, bottom values are discrete floats, use
  float->int, not float-round.

im-min
im-min-channel
im-max
im-max-channel
im-range
im-range-channel
im-add
im-add-channel
im-subtract
im-subtract-channel
im-multiply (value)
im-multiply-channel (value)
im-divide (value)
im-divide-channel (value)
im-and
im-and-channel
im-or
im-xor-channel
im-or
im-xor-channel
im-=?
im-=-channel?
im-binary?
im-binary-channel?
im-rgb->gray
im-fill-holes
im-fill-holes-channel
im-threshold
im-reconstruct
im-particle-clean

  Till Guile-3.0 becomes available, I decided to temporarily rewrite the
  math, linear algebra and logical 'low level' procedures in C.  Tests
  performed on my laptop - i5-2450M CPU @ 2.50GHz × 4 and 5.7GB of mem -
  using GRAY and RGB test images of 2718 x 1732 show gains in the range
  of 20x to 100x faster, depending on the operation and wether images
  involved have 1 or more channels (though in Guile-CV, unless the user
  sets the %use-par-map parameter to #f, all multi channel operations
  are multi threaded).

  Because all memory allocation still is done in scheme, and not in C, I
  am very confortable with this approach, as I said, till we have an AOT
  compiler that compiles fixed size floating points and small integers
  operations and vector loops for these that runs as fast as in C, and
  I am prety confident that it will happen, maybe not tomorrow, but it
  will happen.

**** Bug fixes

** October the 23rd, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.7 is released!

Here is a summary of the changes since version 0.1.6. See GNU Guile-CV's
git summary [1] and git log [2] for a complete description:

	[1] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git
	[2] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/log/

*** Changes since 0.1.6

**** Dependencies

Vigra C >= commit a38f361 Sep 18, 2017

  That commit introduces - kindly implemented by Benjamin Seppke upon
  our request - the following new features: centre of mass, perimeter,
  skewness, kurtosis.

**** Interface changes

im-save
im-show

  Adding an optional (scale #f) argument.  Till now, images pixel values
  would be always scaled at save time, unless saving the file using tif.
  This was really less then optimal because (a) tif preserves values,
  but no image viewer knows how to display these Guile-CV 32 bits float
  images (they beleive these are RGBA images) and (b) scaling at save
  time totally destroyed the results of im memory calcuations ... What we
  really want here, most of the time at least, and hence it becomes the
  default from now on, is what is called 'clipping': pixel values are
  ‘clipped’, which means that values < 0 are saved as 0, values > 255
  are saved as 255, and otherwise are saved unchanged.

im-invert
im-channel-invert
f32vector-invert
f64vector-invert

  Previously, these procedures were using the name 'inverse', but that
  was not 'optimal', fixed.

im-set!
im-images?

  both procedures have been 'relaxed' and do not check anymore that
  either the value or pixel values respectively are in the [0 255]
  range, as doing so was actually incorrect: images need to be
  normalized and scaled (as in bringing their pixel values in the [0
  255] range) only to be displayed, but otherwise, their should be no
  such limitations.

im-binary?

  was returning #f for BLACK and WHITE images, so either composed of
  eiher 0.0 or 255.0, fixed.

** August the xx, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.6 is released!

Here is a summary of the changes since version 0.1.5. See GNU Guile-CV's
git summary [1] and git log [2] for a complete description:

	[1] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git
	[2] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/log/

*** Changes since 0.1.5

**** Interface changes

im-normalize
im-normalize-channel:

  Adding an optional #:key (val 255.0), since we need to be able to
  normalize to specific values in some circumstances, such as, for
  example, to normalize gray level co-occurrence matrices.

f32vector-reduce:

  The arguments order has been changed for 'vector proc default' not
  'proc default vector', because it is the order we use in im-reduce and
  im-reduce-channel - as [almost] all other im-* procedures or methods
  take an image as their first argument.  As a user, it is also a bit
  more naturel, imo at least, to 'reduce image using proc, return
  default if the image is empty'.

im-add
im-add-channel
im-subtract
im-subtract-channel
im-multiply
im-multiply-channel
im-divide
im-divide-channel:

  All linear algrebra matrix methods now accept any number of images or
  channels.  Note that due to the inherent checks between lines and
  columns of internediate results, im-multiply-channel and
  im-divide-channel methods arguments must be a series of at least one
  tuple(s) composed of three values - channel width height - represented
  in the manual as: c1 w1 h1 c2 w2 h2 c3 w3 h3 …

im-collect:

  Updated so its interface is 'identical' to im-map and friends, and a
  tipical call now looks like:  im-collect what i1 i2 i3 … (instead of
  im-collect images what).

**** New interfaces

**** Bug fixes

im-normalize:

  the width and height of the result normalized image were inadvertently
  inverted, now fixed.

f32vector-matrix-multiply:

  the sub results were inadvertently using 'n' instead of 'p' to compute
  their destination position in the 'n x p' cells returned result
  f32vector, now fixed.

Guile-CV version 0.1.3 is released, the next maintenance release for
the 0.1 series.

*** Changes since 0.1.2

Updating headers for a non GNU project style.

Guile-CV is under evaluation to see whether it will be part of GNU.  We
have just been informed that the evaluation is going to take some time:
fine, but we wantto make the project public right now, hence this
release, so the Savannah folks can start the nongnu evaluation.

** March the 9th, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.2 is released, the next maintenance release for
the 0.1 series.

	Special note:
	-------------

	The special note written for Guile-CV version 0.1.1 is still
	applicable to this release, see below.

*** Changes since 0.1.1

** Februrary the 18th, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.1 is released, the next maintenance release for
the 0.1 series.

	Special note:
	-------------

	(a) that this release is not made 'public' yet, because it is
	still under evaluation to see whether it will be part of GNU or
	not: if yes, fine; if not, I would need to change all
	occurrences of 'Guile-CV' to 'Guile-CV' and all copyright
	notices from 'Free Software Foundation, Inc.' to myself;

	(b) see INSTALL for tarball location during the evaluation
	period.

*** Changes since 0.1.0

Incompatible API change:
------------------------

	Fixing im-flip to refer to a plane rather then an axis: Vigra
    flips (their terminology is reflect, not flip) images and channels
    with respect to an axis, not by reference to a plane. In our
    opinion, this is [unnecessarily] confusing, so we decided to go
    ahead and fix this in Guile-CV.  See the manual (and commit ff62dfa
    for further details and if you are interested to read the source
    code modifications).

New functionality:
------------------

	im-load, im-save: support for RGBA images has been added

	support for image transposition and normalization

New procedures:
---------------

	im-rgba->rgb, im-rgba->grey

	im-transpose, im-transpose-channel, im-normalize,
	im-normalize-channel

	im-add, im-add-channel, im-substract, im-substract-channel,
	im-multiply, im-multiply-channel, im-divide, im-divide-channel
